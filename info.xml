  <name>Content Tokens</name>
  <description>This extension provides mail merge tokens that list various content, ie Drupal nodes or WordPress posts. The tokens available are dynamic, based on content types and content terms/categories in the CMS. This is meant to help save time when preparing an email newsletter. If used in combination with a CMS aggregator (Such as the core Drupal aggregator module), then tokens are available for virtually any content source, local or remote. </description>

  <comments>This extension checks which CMS its running under before attempting to do CMS-specific things. It has been tested with Drupal 6 and 7. It should work under WordPress, but testing has been limited. Its safe to install under any CMS or stand-alone. However no useful functionality is provided for Joomla or stand-alone.(Please help improve this on GitHub at https://github.com/sgladstone/com.pogstone.contenttokens) </comments>
